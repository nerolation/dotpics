# DotPics 
[DotPics](https://dotpics.info) is a hobbyist project to provide a comprehensive overview of various aspects about Ethereum. The site features sections on the current MEV landscape (mevboost.pics), on-chain censorship (censorship.pics), reorgs and the parties involved (reorg.pics), stats on Tornado Cash transactions (tornado.pics), and Ethereum's mempool (mempool.pics). 

Additionally, it provides access to open-source data and an API for programmatic access. A Python blockchain parser is also in development. I hope the site is a valuable resource for those interested in detailed insights into Ethereum, no matter if you're a user, developer or infrastructure provider.
